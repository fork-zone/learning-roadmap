# Learning Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This a central place to keep track of what I'm learning to become a full stack developer.

I'm focused on becoming an overall better developer by improving my knowledge of computer science and backend web development.

I'm tracking my progress [speedstudy](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy) style by assigning points to each activity and seeing how many points I can rack up by the end of the year.
